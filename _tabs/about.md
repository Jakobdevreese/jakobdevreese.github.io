## About Me

I work at **Ghent University** on the digitalisation of HVAC systems — developing solutions that integrate building management systems, data analytics, and automation.  
I’m also pursuing a **bachelor’s degree in Applied Informatics (Data Engineering & AI)** at **HOGENT**, where I focus on data quality, ETL pipelines, and AI for energy optimisation.

Alongside technology, I am deeply engaged with cultural heritage as **City Carillonneur of Ghent and Geraardsbergen**, connecting tradition with innovation.

## Strengths

- HVAC programming & system integrations (BACnet, Modbus, APIs)  
- Data engineering (Python, SQL, ETL, data quality profiling)  
- Web back-end development (Django, Node.js/TypeScript)  
- Dashboards & analytics (Power BI, Grafana)  
- DevOps & environments (Linux, Docker, Git)

## Education

- **Applied Informatics (Data Engineering & AI)** — HOGENT  
- Ongoing professional development in HVAC automation, integration, and energy systems
